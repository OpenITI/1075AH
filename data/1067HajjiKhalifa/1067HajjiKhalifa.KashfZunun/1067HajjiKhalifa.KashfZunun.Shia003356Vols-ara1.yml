90#VERS#COMMENT##: Of the three versions of this texts in the corpus, 
    the quality of this text seems to be the best. 
    The main problem with this version is that new books 
    do not always start on new lines.
    The Kashf is organized alphabetically; its entries 
    are either book titles or "genres"/"disciplines" (Ê¿ilm).
    Sometimes, a number of book titles belonging to a genre
    are mentioned under a genre heading, but not always.
    Genre headings have been given ### || tags; 
    the end of a genre subsection needs to be indicated with 
    an empty ### || tag. 
    Book titles have provisionally been given ### $ tags.
    There is still some cleaning work in the genre sections
    (marking book titles within those sections)
