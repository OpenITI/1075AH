90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text contains many typoes (especially in numbers;
    all final zeroes were for some reason deleted, PV restored them). The
    annotation has not been completed, because the Shia version proved of
    better quality.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
